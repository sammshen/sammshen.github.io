title: About me
subtitle: I clearly need to learn web development.

I am a current senior at the University of Chicago. I originally wanted to study pure mathematics and theoretical computer science but decided to pivot into systems programming and software development in Jan 2024 after a(n) (un)fortunate realization that I did not possess the raw intellectual power to make it in the world of mathematical academia.  

Before entropy gets the best of me, I hope my sensory organs feel some cool things, that my neurons fire some cool thoughts, and that my limbs make some cool things.

### Wacky Stuff
I am a believer that computer science as a pure mathematical/philsophical discipline was already completed by 1950. Everything after that was purely for improved operability (e.g. Operating Systems, HCI, Programming Languages, Networking, Databases etc.), though obviously nevertheless super non-trivial (little old me wouldn't dare) and in fact responsible for the impact of computing on modern living. 
- [Charles Babbage designs machinery with addressability, syntax, and operators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.04371) **without** electricity in 1837!!
- [Turing mathematically formalizes computability](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf) in 1936.
- [Konrad Zuse implements first programmable Turing Complete Z3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)) in 1941.
- [Von Neumann Architecture eternalizes patterns of Fetch-Decode-Execute and I/O](https://web.mit.edu/sts.035/www/PDFs/edvac.pdf) in 1945.
- [Claude Shannon formalizes Information Theory and practicalizes Boolean logic into electrical circuits](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf) in 1948.

These works are what I contend are the mathematical/philosophical/engineering kernel of computer science. Of course, every giant stands on the shoulders of gianter giants so an argument can easily be made that the intellectual foundations go further back. I believe every idea in computer science can be traced back to three concepts: 
1. addresses (indirection i.e. geolocation)
2. syntax (memory i.e. delayed signal processing)
3. operators (instructions i.e. physical transformation)

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
