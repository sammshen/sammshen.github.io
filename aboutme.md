subtitle: I clearly need to learn web development.

I am a current senior at the University of Chicago. I originally wanted to study pure mathematics and theoretical computer science but decided to pivot into systems programming and software development in Jan 2024 after a(n) (un)fortunate realization that I did not possess the raw intellectual power to make it in the world of mathematical academia.  

### Wacky Stuff
I am a believer that computer science as a pure mathematical/philsophical discipline was already completed by 1950. Everything after that was purely for improved operability (e.g. Operating Systems, HCI, Programming Languages, Networking, Databases etc.), though obviously nevertheless super non-trivial (little old me wouldn't dare) and in fact responsible for the impact of computing on modern living. 
- [Charles Babbage designs machinery with addressability, syntax, and operators](file:///Users/samuelshen/Documents/babbage.pdf) **without** electricity in 1837!!
- [Turing mathematically formalizes computability](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf) in 1936.
- [Konrad Zuse implements first programmable Turing Complete Z3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)) in 1941.
- [Von Neumann Architecture eternalizes patterns of Fetch-Decode-Execute and I/O](https://web.mit.edu/sts.035/www/PDFs/edvac.pdf) in 1945.
- [Claude Shannon formalizes Information Theory and practicalizes Boolean logic into electrical circuits](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf) in 1948.

This is what I contend is the mathematical/philosophical/engineering kernel of computer science. I believe every idea in computer science can be traced back to three words: addresses (indirection), syntax (memory), and operators (instructions)

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
